How are software docs structured? An exploratory exercise.

Right now looking at levels 1-2. Right now in the format of 


```

Turns out there are [lots of opinions on how to do outlines in Markdown](http://scripting.com/2013/11/21/designExerciseOutlineIndentationAndMarkdown)


## Opinions on how to structure docs
### Google
[Google's Technical Writing Course](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/two/large-docs):
- Outline a document
- Introduce a document
  - What the document covers.
  - What prior knowledge you expect readers to have.
  - What the document doesn't cover.
- Add navigation
  - introduction and summary sections
  - a clear, logical development of the subject
  - headings and subheadings that help users understand the subject
  - a table of contents menu that shows users where they are in the document
  - links to related resources or more in-depth information
  - links to what to learn next
- Prefer task-based headings
- Provide text under each heading
- Disclose information progressively
  - Where possible, try introducing new terminology and concepts near to the instructions that rely on them.
  - Break up large walls of text. To avoid multiple large paragraphs on a single page, aim to introduce tables, diagrams, lists, and headings where appropriate.
  - Break up large series of steps. If you have a particularly long list of complicated steps, try to re-arrange them into shorter lists that explain how to complete sub-tasks.
  - Start with simple examples and instructions, and add progressively more interesting and complicated techniques. For example, in a tutorial for creating forms, start by explaining how to handle text responses, and then introduce other techniques to handle multiple choice, images, and other response types.
